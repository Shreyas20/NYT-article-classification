What never ceases to amaze is the power of persuasion these qualities seem to have over so many Americans.Mr. Comey has shed new light into the mind and persona of Mr. Trump. One can only wish that the “light” radiates beyond the pages of his book.DORIS FENIG, FLORAL PARK, N.Y.To the Editor:Re “Trump Calls Comey ‘Untruthful Slime Ball’ as Book Details Released” (news article, nytimes.com, April 13):When President Trump calls James Comey an “untruthful slime ball,” he could just as easily be talking about himself.Attacking Mr. Comey so vociferously may make political sense, especially when you cannot rebut his charges with the truth, but does this president really believe that the American people will side with him over a man who by all accounts has lived up to his sworn oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic?MICHAEL SCOTT, SAN FRANCISCOTo the Editor:Re “The Law Is Coming, Mr. Trump” (editorial, April 11):To this I can only add, “Please hurry.” No one should be surprised if within the coming days President Trump embroils us in some sort of international or domestic crisis in order to take the focus off his legal troubles. Either that, or he will simply fire Robert Mueller and prepare to ride out the storm.The bottom line is, Mr. Trump has a real gift for self-survival and will stop at absolutely nothing, whatever the cost to the country or the Constitution, to ensure that survival. Having thwarted both the law and justice, he will then tweet his satisfaction at seeing the “witch hunt” brought to an end.JOE ELLIOTT, ASHEVILLE, N.C.To the Editor:I am no fan of President Trump, but I believe he should be commended when he does the right thing. Your April 13 front-page article “Trump Weighs Rejoining Accord With Pacific Rim in About-Face” is good news. We should be stressing the potential positive outcomes from this decision (especially for American farmers) rather than the fact that it is an “about-face.”As the article points out, it is not a done deal, and stressing Mr. Trump’s inconsistency might well cause the mercurial president to change his mind again.Let us not allow our distaste for the man to overshadow good policies when they occur.DANIEL R. MARTIN, HARTSDALE, N.Y.Advertisement
