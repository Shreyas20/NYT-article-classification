All you have to do is listen and then consider which of the two claimants — James Comey or President Trump — is telling the truth. In simplest terms, in this case are you going to believe a man who has undoubtedly told a few lies here and there? Or one who tells, on average, five easily disprovable lies every day of his presidential life?In sum, Mr. Comey comes across as a very credible human trying, and failing sometimes, to do what is incontrovertibly morally right.PETER NEAMAN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Given the consequences of James Comey’s rogue and self-serving decision-making during the 2016 election, it makes me more than mildly nauseated to think that he now profits from his tell-all. He should donate his earnings to civic organizations working to protect ordinary people here and around the world who are suffering under President Trump’s agenda.SHARI JACOBSON, LEWISBURG, PA.To the Editor:I applaud James Comey’s forthrightness in describing his interactions with President Trump. But I disagree with his assertion that the best way to remove Mr. Trump from office would be to vote him out because impeachment would be a kind of “short-circuit” process and would “let the American people off the hook.”Impeachment is carried out by the elected representatives of the American people, responding, hopefully, to their will, and to the guidelines of American law. So I don’t see it as any kind of short-circuit.Besides, we can’t afford to wait until the next election. Every day that this unfit person remains in office is a stain on our history and a potential national emergency — as evidenced by Mr. Comey’s own testimony.VICKI RIBA KOESTLERALEXANDRIA, VA.Advertisement
