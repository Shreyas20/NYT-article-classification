Stephen Colbert told his audience about it in an unplanned segment after the post-monologue commercial break.THIS JUST IN: Trump gets an offer from North Korea that he can't refuse. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/MS9KLAtdqD“This can only mean one thing. Dennis Rodman is going to get the Nobel Peace Prize,” Colbert said.His team was deft in coming up with punchlines on short notice. (And Colbert’s warning that “I’m not entirely sure what I’m about to say” may have indicated that, impressively, he came up with the jokes on the spot.)He had a few more lines up his sleeve, including:“Because North Korea is an economically starved country, the invitation is B-Y-O-Everything.”“They’ve gone from ‘We’ll blow up Guam!’ to ‘We pinkie swear not to blow up Guam for a few days.’”“We’ll finally figure out who has a bigger button.”“Trump is thinking of making it a national holiday. Not because he supports women: because he wants another day off.” — JIMMY FALLON“KFC replaced its iconic Colonel Sanders logo with his wife, Claudia.” — JIMMY FALLON“President Trump is flying to California next week for the first time since he took office. When asked if he’ll visit LAX, he said, ‘I’ll visit my L.A. ex, my San Diego ex, my San Francisco ex. I have lots of exes all over the West Coast.” — JIMMY FALLON“So the North Korean leader extended an olive branch to Donald Trump, which is a big deal because olive branches are really the only thing they have to eat there.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“By May? He’s not still going to be president by May. This needs to happen by Wednesday. Imagine Kim Jong-un meeting Donald Trump. The two worst haircuts in the world together.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“There’s an attempt to silence porn star Stormy Daniels by President Trump’s lawyer. Yeah. Yeah, it’s kind of sad that, in that sentence, the most degrading job mentioned was President Trump’s lawyer.” — CONAN O’BRIEN“President Trump is planning a meeting about violence with the heads of the video game industry. Yeah. However, some people worry that it’s just a trap so that Trump can deport the Mario brothers.” — CONAN O’BRIEN“In the Northeast, one million people are without power because of a blizzard. Yeah. And in Wisconsin, one million people are without power because of gerrymandering. That one was just for The New York Times.” — CONAN O’BRIEN (Thank you, Conan. We’ve got you.)The greatest sidekick in N.B.A. history, Kobe Bryant, sat down with Jimmy Kimmel to discuss winning an Oscar. His film, “Dear Basketball,” won last weekend for best animated short.“I’m still tripping about it,” Bryant told Kimmel.Kimmel asked him what he didn’t get to say in his acceptance speech.“There’s a greater sense of responsibility,” Bryant said. “How do I provide more opportunities for even more diverse and new voices to be heard in this industry? In the animation business, there’s a serious lack of diversity.”Josh Sharp and Aaron Jackson, two correspondents for “The Opposition With Jordan Klepper,” did a field segment in Kentucky profiling David Ermold, who is running to replace Kim Davis, the county clerk who rejected Ermold’s marriage license. it was an eyebrow-raising segment. Near the end, Sharp and Jackson confronted Davis at her office to mockingly warn her about her opponent.Jackson said, “Did you know there’s qualified candidates running against you in the upcoming election?”Sharp followed with, “And he doesn’t even want to use religion to take away people’s rights.”In Friday night’s “A Closer Look” segment, Seth Meyers did a deep dive into the recent spate of stories regarding the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. But first, Meyers snuck in a Stormy Daniels barb.“The president of the United States got a restraining order against a porn star, which means we have to say goodbye to the old lowest point in American history,” Meyers said.Meyers then summarized reports that Mueller has obtained evidence that Erik Prince, the founder of the contracting company Blackwater, had met with an ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in an effort to establish a backchannel to the Kremlin early last year.“Wait. You’re telling me a secret meeting on a remote island in the Indian Ocean between a mercenary and an agent of the Kremlin turned out to be suspicious?” Meyers quipped.Enjoy the weekend, everybody. And while you do that, take a gander at this profile of Lionel Richie, who will be a judge on the coming season of “American Idol.”Advertisement
