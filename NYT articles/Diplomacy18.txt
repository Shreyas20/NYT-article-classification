Yellow indicates area within range of missiles.“We believe we’re entering a missile renaissance,” said Ian Williams, an associate director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has been compiling data on missile programs in different countries.A growing number of countries with ready access to missiles increases regional tensions and makes war more likely, Mr. Williams said. Countries are more apt to use their arsenals if they think their missiles could be targeted.In addition, many of the missiles being developed by these countries are based on obsolete technologies, which makes them less accurate, increasing the risk to civilians. And there is a risk that missiles could fall into the hands of militias and terrorist groups.Many of the countries that have heavily invested in missiles over the last two decades are in well-known hotspots in Asia and the Middle East. Their maximum ranges are overlaid on the map below.Estimated maximum missile range.Countries investing in missiles are often trying to deter regional adversaries. But the effects of this arms race ripple across the globe.North Korea is an example of the danger. Estimates of the country’s maximum missile range went from 745 miles in 1990 to more than 8,000 miles now. That’s enough to strike about half of the world, including the United States mainland. (During the same period, South Korea gained the ability to strike anywhere in North Korea.)Countries like Iran, North Korea and Pakistan have robust missile development programs. And the similarity of some of their missiles indicates that they have collaborated to share technology.Pakistan began investing more heavily in its missile program in the 1990s and is believed to have also collaborated with China. By the mid-2000s, Pakistan had the ability to strike most of India, its main regional rival.India, in turn, became capable of striking anywhere in Pakistan and most of China, another regional rival, in the last two decades. India is now collaborating with Russia to develop cruise missiles.Saudi Arabia and Israel were already able to strike Iran before 1990. But now Iran could strike back at either country, thanks in part to technology it acquired from North Korea.Additionally, both India and North Korea are working on submarine-launched missiles, which would enable the two nations to better hide their missiles to use in retaliatory strikes.Another area of concern is militias or terrorist groups getting access to missiles.One clear example of this happened in November, when a ballistic missile fired from Yemen reached Saudi Arabia’s capital. The missile was fired by Houthi rebels, a Shiite militia that took control of large parts of Yemen three years ago and that is backed by Iran and Hezbollah, a militant group from Lebanon.The Arab League has accused the Houthis of firing dozens of missiles against Saudi Arabia since the kingdom began an offensive to oust the rebels in 2015.500 milesEstimated minimum rangeof Houthi missile.RiyadhSaudiArabiaYemenTerritory held bythe Houthisduring the attack620 milesEstimated maximummissile range.500 milesEstimated minimum rangeof Houthi missile.RiyadhSaudiArabiaYemenTerritory held bythe Houthisduring the attack620 milesEstimated maximummissile range.The weapon used against Saudi Arabia was a variation of the Scud missile.The Scud and its variations have become some of the most common missiles in the world. Russia originally developed the Scud in the 1950s to carry weapons of mass destruction.The missile played a crucial role in weapons programs of countries like North Korea and Iran. The weapons produced by North Korea are examples of how difficult it is to stop missiles from spreading.Despite decades of sanctions, the country developed a family of ballistic missiles using lessons learned from the Scud. Some of the descendants were sold to other nations.How a Few Missiles Become ManyNorth Korea acquired a small number of Scud B missiles, support equipment and technology around 1980, apparently from Egypt, and worked to reverse engineer the design.EgyptEarly1980sThe country has exported or planned to export its version of the Scud, the Hwasong-5, or its variations, to nearly a dozen countries, including Iran.North KoreaHwasong-51986IranShahab-1, 1987and -2, 1997SyriaHouthi rebels(Yemen)Iran also developed the ability to produce their own Scud versions and is suspected of passing some to the Syrian government and the Houthi militia in Yemen.Lessons from the Scud allowed North Korea to develop the No Dong missile, capable of reaching up to 930 miles.

But it’s nearly impossible to stop the trade in smaller parts, like guidance systems and engines, as well as human expertise. A single computer thumb drive can hold many secrets.And, sometimes, a single piece can be the catalyst for a breakthrough: A powerful Soviet engine design that North Korea acquired is thought to be a main driver of the country’s recent advances.Dr. Lewis added that that many counties are now learning the secrets of rocketry and how to make progressively more threatening models. India, for example, is working on a missile that could enable it to strike nearly half of the planet.4,970 milesEstimated maximum range of a missilethat India is developing.4,970 milesEstimated maximum range of amissile that India is developing.The rising threat of missile proliferation has sparked new control efforts by the Missile Technology Control Regime, a group of 35 countries that seeks to restrict exports of missiles and their components.The group in a recent statement highlighted the “critical importance” of its work for addressing the rapid changes in how weapons are developed and transferred.But some analysts are skeptical that it is possible to stop missile transfers. “The prospects for controlling proliferation of missiles are fading rapidly as the technology to build them becomes more prosaic,” Dr. Lewis said.
